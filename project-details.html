        <h2>Project Title: Trade Bucks</h2>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            Trade Bucks is a platform designed for crypto trading. It includes an inbuilt bot that helps users trade using a 
            Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy. The project was developed as part of a first-year team software project. 
            The bot’s primary function is to assist traders by automating the buy/sell strategy based on market fluctuations.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <p>
            The platform was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The back-end was developed 
            using Python and Django to handle server-side logic, user authentication, and manage database operations.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
        <p>
            One of the challenges faced during development was integrating the trading bot with the crypto market APIs. 
            Ensuring the bot could accurately execute trades in real-time was a complex task. However, through collaboration and 
            testing, the bot was successfully integrated to execute automated trades with minimal delays.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <p>
            In the future, we aim to expand the platform to allow users to trade in multiple markets, not just crypto. 
            We also plan to improve the bot’s functionality by adding more trading strategies and fine-tuning the algorithm for 
            better decision-making.
