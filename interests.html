        <h2>Fintech and Algorithmic Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            I am deeply interested in the intersection of technology and finance, particularly in the field of Fintech. My goal is to work as an algorithmic engineer, where I can develop and optimize trading algorithms that drive financial markets. I enjoy the challenge of creating solutions that merge computational efficiency with real-world financial applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My technical expertise includes programming in C++, Python, and Java. I am particularly passionate about applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in finance, from predictive modeling to risk analysis. Exploring innovative ways to enhance financial systems through technology is what drives me.
